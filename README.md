## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first approach
- Javascript
- DOM Manipulation - Utilizing the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the webpage content.
- Async Functions - Employing asynchronous functions to handle data fetching from APIs without blocking the main thread.
- Fetch Data - Using the Fetch Data to retrieve data asynchronously from external sources.

### What I learned

- Efficient HTML structure: I learned how to architect my HTML documents in a clean and organized manner, ensuring semantic markup and accessibility.

- Effective use of CSS classes: I gained proficiency in creating reusable CSS classes, enabling consistent styling across the project and facilitating easier maintenance.

- Dynamic content injection: Through DOM manipulation, I discovered how to dynamically inject information into my web pages.

- Practical use of async functions: I learned how to utilize async functions effectively in JavaScript to perform asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from APIs.

- Looping over selectors: I discovered how to loop over selectors in the DOM, enabling me to dynamically target multiple elements and apply changes or updates uniformly.


### Continued development

- Enhancing code quality: I believe there's room for improvement in writing more optimized and maintainable code by adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. I aim to explore techniques and patterns that promote cleaner, more efficient code in future projects.
